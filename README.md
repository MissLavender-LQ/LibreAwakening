# Contributing to LibreAwakening

Contributions to *LibreAwakening* are always welcome, however, there are a few guidelines that should be followed:

## Intellectual property

We know people hate legalese, but this is important. This applies to **everything** which is submitted.

The general rules go as follows:

  1. You must have permission for everything you submit. If you make your own resources, do not base them on resources from *Link's Awakening* or any other restricted work. If you take work from other places, please make sure that the work is freely-licensed or that you obtain permission to include it in the *LibreAwakening* project. They may not place additional restrictions compared to the normal *LibreAwakening* license.

  2. Do not try to emulate *Link's Awakening* resources exactly. Where possible, put effort to make new versions look visibly different from *Link's Awakening*.

  3. Be especially careful of “free textures” (or “free sounds” or “free graphics”) sites.  Although these would appear at first to be okay to use, many are free for “non-commercial use only.” One of the things we want to be able to do is put this in GNU/Linux distributions (which can be sold or developed commercially).

  4. Make sure if you do find something thats under an open source licence make sure that its either *CC BY 4.0* or *CC0*


## Submitting your work

The most common, and a fairly simple method, to submit your work is by posting it on the ~~LibreAwakening Discord~~ (does not exist yet)

This allows a quick cycle of development and feedback.

An alternative to using the forum is to post your submission on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MissLavender-LQ/LibreAwakening/issues), which may also be peer-reviewed and provide a feedback cycle.

Unfortunately, the LibreAwakening project cannot provide hosting space in the form of a webpage nor FTP, however, there are many free file hosts to use when you need a location to upload files. Sites and services such as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Mega](https://mega.co.nz/), as well as others, are common and should be simple to use.

### Crediting information

*LibreAwakening* is made up of submissions from many people all over the globe. All of them, including **you**, deserve credit! Please do not forget to provide your name and email when submitting resources.

### Using Git

You can also commit on a clone of the *LibreAwakening* repository, although this is a technical task and it is okay to let other *LibreAwakening* maintainers to do it instead: that is our normal mode of operation. However, pull requests are much appreciated and you may submit them in any manner you wish, with GitHub’s direct pull requests being the simplest, but by far not the only means.

*LibreAwakening* uses the commit message style commonly seen in distributed version control systems, adopted by projects such as Linux and Git. For an explanation of this style, see [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
